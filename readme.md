The HTML5 / Javascript application (comic.js and index.html) is licensed AGPL.

JSCOLOR is maintained by Jan Odvarko and is licensed LGPL; more info can be found at http://jscolor.com. The jscolor code has been very slightly tweaked to replace external images with data URIs, to cut down on HTTP requests.

All the images (including icons) are in the public domain; they can be used freely without any restrictions. Giving attribution to the artist is encouraged but not required.

The CSS design and layout are not unique enough to copyrighted, and can be copied or reused freely.
